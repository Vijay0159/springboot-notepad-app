# Project: Notepad Application (Spring Boot + MySQL + JSP)

A full-stack Notepad web application with a modern UI/UX, built using Spring Boot, Hibernate (JPA), MySQL, and JSP. It supports secure user authentication, file upload, CRUD operations, download (single/bulk), theming, soft delete via trash, and dashboard navigation. Recent updates include search, confirm password, cascade delete, and full JSP redesigns.

---

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- **Modular Design**
  Clear separation between controller, service, repository, and entity layers ensured maintainability.

- **Session-Based Authentication**
  User login state managed via session attributes (`userId`, `username`).

- **Full CRUD Support**
  Notes can be created, updated, deleted (soft/permanent), and fetched by ID or filename.

- **File Upload (Single .txt)**
  Users can upload `.txt` files with optional custom filenames, extension normalization, and special character validation.

- **Download Support**
  Users can download notes individually or bulk-download all as a `.zip`.

- **Trash Panel**
  Deleted notes move to trash with timestamp; can be restored or deleted permanently.

- **Dashboard Revamp**
  The dashboard now features responsive cards, hover effects, and better layout management.

- **Theme Toggle (Light/Dark + More)**
  Multiple themes (light, dark, rose, lavender, aqua) using CSS variables and `<select>`-based toggle.

- **JSP-Wide Modal Support**
  All forms/actions now give modal-based feedback with contextual options like ‚ÄúStay Here‚Äù and ‚ÄúGo to Dashboard‚Äù.

- **Cascade Delete**
  Deleting a user now removes all their notes and trashed entries automatically.

- **Confirm Password Support**
  Added confirm password validation during registration to ensure better UX.

- **Client-Side Search (All Notes)**
  Search bar added to filter notes by filename directly on the UI without hitting the server.

- **Fully Refactored JSPs**
  All pages (create, delete, update, fetch, upload, register, trash, etc.) now follow modern layout, spacing, and font styling for a professional experience.

## ‚ùå What Went Wrong / Fixes Applied

- **Inconsistent File Handling**
  Fixed filename extension appending logic and duplication issues using central helper logic.

- **Poor Modal Design Early On**
  Refactored all modal boxes with padding, spacing, and better button placement using flexbox.

- **Trash Date Missing**
  Previously, deletedAt timestamps were not rendered due to missing `<fmt:formatDate>` taglib. This was corrected.

- **Overflow in Note Content**
  Added proper wrapping, scrolling, and structure in note content containers (`<pre>`) to avoid horizontal scrolling.

- **Account Delete Left Notes Behind**
  Initially, user notes remained even after account deletion. This is now fixed using proper cascade behavior at DB and entity level.

---

## üß± Problems We Overcame

- ‚úÖ Uniform modal logic across all actions.
- ‚úÖ Style overhaul with responsive containers, adaptive spacing.
- ‚úÖ Note search implemented fully in frontend (client-side search).
- ‚úÖ Confirm password validation logic added in both backend and JSP.
- ‚úÖ Cascade delete via `orphanRemoval = true` and `@OneToMany` relationship.
- ‚úÖ Content overflow fix in fetch-by-ID and fetch-by-filename JSPs.
- ‚úÖ Fixed trash note timestamp visibility via proper JSTL formatting.

## üå± Roadmap Ahead

### üì• Import & Upload

- **Bulk Upload from ZIP (with unique .txt files)** üîú  
  Users can upload multiple text files at once.

- **File Validation**  
  Ensure `.txt` extension and uniqueness before accepting uploaded files.

### üì¶ Bulk Operations

- **Checkbox-Based Bulk Select** üîú  
  Add support in All Notes and Trash views for selecting multiple notes.

- **Bulk Download (Selective)**  
  Selected notes to be downloaded as a `.zip` (single file = `.txt`).

- **Bulk Delete (All Notes)**  
  Move selected notes to trash.

- **Bulk Restore / Delete (Trash)**  
  Restore or permanently delete selected trashed notes.

### ‚úçÔ∏è UI Enhancements

- Add subtle tooltips, animations, and accessibility improvements.
- Add help text or short instructions above complex features (like bulk actions).

### üß† AI Assistant (Post-MVP)

- Let user type a prompt like ‚Äúsummarize India‚Äôs freedom struggle‚Äù and the app auto-generates a note using GPT.
