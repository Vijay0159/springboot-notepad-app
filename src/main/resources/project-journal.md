# Project: Notepad Application (Spring Boot + MySQL + JSP)

A full-stack Notepad web application with a modern UI/UX, built using Spring Boot, Hibernate (JPA), MySQL, and JSP. It supports secure user authentication, file upload, CRUD operations, download (single/bulk), theming, soft delete via trash, and dashboard navigation. Recent updates include search, confirm password, cascade delete, and full JSP redesigns.

---

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- **Modular Design**  
  Clear separation between controller, service, repository, and entity layers ensured maintainability.

- **Session-Based Authentication**  
  User login state managed via session attributes (`userId`, `username`).

- **Full CRUD Support**  
  Notes can be created, updated, deleted (soft/permanent), and fetched by ID or filename.

- **File Upload (Single .txt)**  
  Users can upload `.txt` files with optional custom filenames, extension normalization, and special character validation.

- **Download Support**  
  Users can download notes individually or bulk-download all as a `.zip`.

- **Trash Panel**  
  Deleted notes move to trash with timestamp; can be restored or deleted permanently.

- **Dashboard Revamp**  
  The dashboard now features responsive cards, hover effects, and better layout management.

- **Theme Toggle (Light/Dark + More)**  
  Multiple themes (light, dark, rose, lavender, aqua) using CSS variables and `<select>`-based toggle.

- **JSP-Wide Modal Support**  
  All forms/actions now give modal-based feedback with contextual options like ‚ÄúStay Here‚Äù and ‚ÄúGo to Dashboard‚Äù.

- **Cascade Delete**  
  Deleting a user now removes all their notes and trashed entries automatically.

- **Confirm Password Support**  
  Added confirm password validation during registration to ensure better UX.

- **Client-Side Search (All Notes)**  
  Search bar added to filter notes by filename directly on the UI without hitting the server.

- **Fully Refactored JSPs**  
  All pages (create, delete, update, fetch, upload, register, trash, etc.) now follow modern layout, spacing, and font styling for a professional experience.

- **Bulk Actions Implemented** ‚úÖ
  - Bulk download: If 1 note, download as `.txt`; else, `.zip`.
  - Bulk delete (All Notes): Moves to Trash.
  - Bulk restore & permanent delete (Trash).
  - Custom modals per bulk action.
  - Validations ensure no action proceeds without selection.

---

## ‚ùå What Went Wrong / Fixes Applied

- **Inconsistent File Handling**  
  Fixed filename extension appending logic and duplication issues using central helper logic.

- **Poor Modal Design Early On**  
  Refactored all modal boxes with padding, spacing, and better button placement using flexbox.

- **Trash Date Missing**  
  Previously, deletedAt timestamps were not rendered due to missing `<fmt:formatDate>` taglib. This was corrected.

- **Overflow in Note Content**  
  Added proper wrapping, scrolling, and structure in note content containers (`<pre>`) to avoid horizontal scrolling.

- **Account Delete Left Notes Behind**  
  Initially, user notes remained even after account deletion. This is now fixed using proper cascade behavior at DB and entity level.

- **Trash.jsp Crash on Missing Tags**  
  Fixed unterminated `<c:if>` issue and prevented accidental modal rendering when no notes exist.

---

## üß± Problems We Overcame

- ‚úÖ Uniform modal logic across all actions.
- ‚úÖ Style overhaul with responsive containers, adaptive spacing.
- ‚úÖ Note search implemented fully in frontend (client-side search).
- ‚úÖ Confirm password validation logic added in both backend and JSP.
- ‚úÖ Cascade delete via `orphanRemoval = true` and `@OneToMany` relationship.
- ‚úÖ Content overflow fix in fetch-by-ID and fetch-by-filename JSPs.
- ‚úÖ Fixed trash note timestamp visibility via proper JSTL formatting.
- ‚úÖ Modal rendering on empty notes prevented via conditional blocks.
- ‚úÖ Form validation ensures bulk actions need at least one selected checkbox.

## üå± Roadmap Ahead

### üì• Import & Upload
- **Bulk Upload from ZIP (with unique .txt files)** üîú  
  Users can upload multiple text files at once.
- **File Validation**  
  Ensure `.txt` extension and uniqueness before accepting uploaded files.

### üè∑Ô∏è Tags & Categories
- **Assign Tags to Notes**  
  Support adding categories/tags to notes during creation/edit.
- **Filter by Tag**  
  Let user view/filter notes by selected category.

### üîê Password Features
- **Password Reset / Change Flow**  
  Allow users to change password securely via form (and later via email/token).

### üßπ Auto Clean-up
- **Auto-Empty Trash**  
  Auto-delete trashed notes after 30 days using a background scheduler.

### ‚úçÔ∏è UI Enhancements
- Add subtle tooltips, animations, and accessibility improvements.
- Add help text or short instructions above complex features (like bulk actions).

### ü§ñ AI Assistant (Optional / Time-Permitting)
- Let user type a prompt like ‚Äúsummarize India‚Äôs freedom struggle‚Äù and auto-generate a note using OpenAI/GPT.
